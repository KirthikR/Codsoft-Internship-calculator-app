# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP CALCULATOR WEB APPLICATION
# HTML Structure:

* HTML provides the structure of the web page. In this code, we use HTML elements such as <div> for container and screen, and <button> for calculator buttons.
* Each element is styled and positioned using CSS to create the visual layout of the calculator.
# CSS Styling:

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements.
* In this code, CSS rules are applied to style the calculator, including colors, fonts, button sizes, and transitions.
# JavaScript Functions:

* JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic behavior on web pages.
* In this code, JavaScript functions are used to handle user interactions and perform calculations.
* The appendCharacter(char) function adds characters to the screen when buttons are clicked.
* The clearScreen() function clears the screen when the AC button is clicked.
* The calculate() function evaluates the expression on the screen and displays the result when the equals button is clicked.
# Event Handling:

* Event handling in JavaScript allows us to respond to user actions, such as button clicks.
* In this code, event listeners are attached to the buttons using the onclick attribute, which calls specific JavaScript functions when buttons are clicked.
# Dynamic Content:

* The calculator dynamically updates the screen content based on user input and performs calculations in real-time.
* This dynamic behavior is achieved using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML elements and update the screen accordingly.
# Error Handling:

Error handling is an important aspect of programming to handle unexpected situations gracefully.
In this code, error handling is implemented in the calculate() function to catch and display errors, such as division by zero.
